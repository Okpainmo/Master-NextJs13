# Master NextJs 13
A tutorial project to help ease the adoption of NextJs 13 among developers.

## How To Learn With This Repository.

This README file will contain a detailed documentation of all the aspects of NextJs 13 that will be covered. Code examples will also be included with links to live implementations in the project that will be included inside this repository.

## Installing a new NextJs 13 app

Installing a new NextJs 13 app is pretty easy. Simply paste in the installation command below, and reply to every prompt that will be returned. Make selections to suit your preferences.

> ```
>
>npx create-next-app@latest
>
>```

- You can find more help with installation in this [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/3aC4bytEa_I).
## How to use the NextJs 13 docs

> I highly recommend that you use the NextJs 13 docs, and you proceed with learning NextJs 13. Using the docs, will help you master NextJs 13 beyond the limits taught inside tutorials.

The NextJs 13 docs currently contains documentation content for both the "app router", and the "pages router" since the "pages router" is still supported in NextJs 13.

It's important to learn how to use the docs because one can stumble into the docs, and proceed to read and implement instructions for a different(wrong) router while hoping to have gotten implementation instructions for the desired router. This is very likely to happen when you access the docs from an external link.

## Understanding the NextJs 13 application folder structure

The NextJs 13 app like other package installations comes with some files and folder to help bootstrap your project. The main folder of concern, is the app folder which contains the core of our NextJs application.

Two important files that come with the app folder, are the "page" file, and the "layout" file. These files are reserved files in Nextjs 13. They are reserved to serve specific page needs. Reserved files in NextJs 13 will be covered in more detail inside subsequent video(s).

- More on the NextJs project folder structure, and these reserved files was well covered in this this [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/GvULBGU2iEg)
